This project contains a Simulink model of a counter that increments based on a pulse generator. It only counts on the rising edge of the pulse and includes a reset function.
How It Works

    The counter increases by 1 every time a rising edge is detected in the input pulse.
    If the reset signal is triggered, the counter goes back to zero.
    The model uses logic gates and memory blocks to ensure it only reacts to rising edges.
    Switching to a fixed-step solver resolves timing issues that occur when the pulse width is too small.
