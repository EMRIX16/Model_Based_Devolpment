This project simulates a Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) and includes a coherence failure scenario. The system relies on two sensors:

    One sensor outputs 0.5V to 4.5V.

    The other sensor works in reverse, from 4.5V to 0.5V.

    Their combined output should always add up to 5V to ensure proper functionality.

What's Included

    A Simulink model that replicates the TPS operation.

    Software-in-the-loop (SIL) testing to check performance.

    Automatic code generation to prepare for real-time use.

How to Use

    Run the "TPS_Modes.m" file firstâ€”it defines an enumeration used in the model.

    Open the Simulink model.

    Start the simulation to see how the TPS behaves.

    Use SIL testing to validate the system.
